          <h2>1) Executive Summary</h2>
    
          <p>
            Climate change increases macroeconomic tail risk: low-probability, high-severity disasters (hurricanes, floods, wildfires)
            can generate large and persistent output losses. The core thesis idea is that <b>tail events do not propagate through the economy
            like scaled-up normal shocks</b> because they interact with (i) household balance sheets and precautionary behavior and (ii) leveraged
            financial intermediaries.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            The thesis proposes a nonlinear HANK-DSGE model with nominal rigidities and a central bank rule, augmented with an intermediary
            sector (“experts”/banks) subject to a leverage (skin-in-the-game) constraint. The model is designed to produce a <b>double amplification</b>:
          </p>
    
          <ul>
            <li><b>Inequality/MPC channel:</b> heterogeneous households (borrowing constraints, wealth distribution) imply that income/wealth shocks hit high-MPC agents hardest, amplifying aggregate demand contractions.</li>
            <li><b>Financial accelerator channel:</b> disasters erode intermediary net worth, tighten leverage constraints, widen spreads, and depress investment/output—creating feedback loops.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <p>
            Methodologically, the thesis relies on modern nonlinear solution tools (automatic differentiation and sequence-space style solvers)
            and, if feasible, an ML layer (neural network surrogate) to enable extensive scenario analysis and/or estimation. 
          </p>
    
          <div class="callout">
            <b>Thesis claim (in one line):</b>
            The macro impact of climate rare disasters is <b>state-dependent and strongly amplified</b> when inequality-driven MPC heterogeneity interacts
            with leveraged intermediation—changing the monetary policy trade-off relative to representative-agent climate DSGEs.
